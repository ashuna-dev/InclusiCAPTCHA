# InclusiCAPTCHA
In our daily internet usage, we often encounter CAPTCHA, a tool designed to verify whether a user requesting web content is human. While it poses little difficulty for most users, visually impaired individuals face challenges when using text-to-speech software. Even with the existence of audio CAPTCHAs, the problem persists and can be exacerbated.

This project aims to address the issue faced by blind internet users who struggle to prove their humanity when interacting online. How can we provide a solution that enables visually impaired individuals to navigate the internet without the hindrance of traditional CAPTCHA mechanisms?
